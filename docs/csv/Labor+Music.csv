Until I'm dead and there's nothin' to show for my uses

Nobody told me it'd be easy
Or for that matter, it'd be so hard
But it's the livin' and learnin'
It makes the difference
It makes it all worthwhile
It makes it all worthwhile

Workin' this job, there's nothin' left but to hate it

","“Working all day for a mean little man, With a clip-on tie and a rub-on tan, He's got me runnin around the office, Like a dog around a track, But when I get back home you're always there to rub my back
Hey Julie look what they're doing to me, Tryin to trip me up, Tryin to wear me down, Julie I swear it's so hard to bear it, And I'd never make it through without you around, No I'd never make it through without you around
Hours on the phone making pointless calls, I got a desk full of paper that means nothing at all, Sometimes I catch myself staring into space, Countin' down the hours til I get to see your face
...Why must I spend my time, Fillin' up my mind, With facts and figures that never add up anyway, They never add up anyway
Workin all day for a mean little guy, With a bad toupee and a soup-stain tie, He's got me runnin around the office, Like a gerbil on a wheel, He can tell me what to do, But he can't tell me what to feel”","Chris Collingwood, Adam Schlesinger","2003","Pop",,,

Hola Mijo!
Papito! Cuando vas a venir?
Hola mi niño que tal, yo sigo aca
Con ganas de verlos
No los dejo de extrañar
Y cada vez mas, los echo de menos
Dime como esta mama
Dile por favor que están en mi mente
Que eh venido a triunfar
No hay mas que aguantar, debemos ser fuertes
Cuando es que vas a volver
Te oigo preguntar y me tiemblan los labios
Si yo pudiera volar, poder tener alas y estar a tu lado
Cuando es que vas a volver
Y yo sin pensar te digo que pronto
Lagrimas del corazon
Hijo de mi alma estoy derramando
Que triste es estar lejos de sus queridos
Y todo por salir adelante
Dime como esta el bebe
Ese pequeñin que tanto yo sueno
Si lo pudiera tener, mirarlo crecer
Es lo que deseo
Dile a tu hermana mayor
Que si quiere dios, voy para sus quince
Para bailar ese valz que le prometí
Antes de Venirme
Translation
Hello!?
Hello my son!
Daddy! When are you coming?1
 
Hello my boy, how are you?, I'm still here
I really want to see you both2
I can't stop missing you all,
And each time more than the last,
Tell me, how's your mother doing?
Please tell her you're both in my thoughts,
That I've come to be successful,
There's nothing more to do than to hold on, we must be strong
]
When are you coming back?,
I hear you ask and my lips tremble,
If only I could fly, and have wings to be by your side
When are you coming back?,
And without thinking I tell you: Soon
Tears from the heart,
My dearest son, I'm falling apart
 
It's sad to be so far from your loved ones,
And all because one must succeed.
 
Tell me how the baby's doing,
That little one that I dream of so much,
If I could hold him, watch him grown up
It's what I want most,
Tell your older sister,
If God is willing, I'll be there for her quinceañera
To dance that waltz I promised her,
Before I left and came here.","Grupo Montez de Durango","2007","Regional Mexican- Durangense Music",,,

Pick the harvest, who does the
Cleaning, hotels and restaurants, and
who is killed working in construction
While the Boss scolds, weaving the
Web in his luxurious mansion.
Many times they do not pay us, so that when
We get sore and we come out poisoned
They throw us immigration                                                  Summary: 
The immigrant worker (from Mexico) works really hard in the fields, construction, housekeeping, and food industry only for the Boss to get richer. The part where it states “weaving the web” signifies how the Boss grows his wealth through the labor of the migrant Mexican workers. Also, when migrant Mexican workers are not able to work due to injury or sickness, the Boss responds with “Immigration”. Immigration in terms of deportation of these workers outside the United States into Mexico.

You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you.
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong,
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long.
You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.
It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.","Almanac Singers, Eric Bernay","July 1941","Folk",,,

How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number 3: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number 4: I know you heard this before
Never get high on your own supply
Number 5: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em bounce!
Number 6: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
7: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two d**ks and no b***h
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8: never keep no weight on you!
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the f**k from police
If n****s think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'

Why am I working here? It ain't working here
It ain't worth it here, never gonna persevere
Ain't no money for new shoes or purses here
Should've done my first career (huh) nursing yeah
Now I'm sitting here thinking 'bout the work I put in

Studying means work
Working means dough (cash)
Having money oney means expenses
Having credit means debt (or claims)
Being in debt means the repo-man coming
And then you're in deep ####
Being in love means having kids
Saying forever means divorce
Having loved ones says mourning as problems never come alone
Who says crisis tell you world & says famine says third-world
Who says tiredness says awakening still deaf from last night
So we go out to forget all our problems
So we dance

Got everything I own
