Broadway, where a band played for dancers. The events marked the end of a 76 day strike by some 7,100 Milwaukee brewery workers.  The vote accepting the new contract was not unanimous and the settlement did not produce a 35 hour work week for all employes of the six breweries involved - which had been a bargaining issue.  (The breweries, in addition to Blatz, were Gettleman, Independent Milwaukee, Miller, Pabst and Schlitz.)  The settlement did provide for a pension plan, 20¢ an hour wage increase and health and life insurance benefits, among other gains.  According to newspaper accounts, resolution of the dispute came rapidly after Blatz - in separate negotiations - made an agreement with the union a few days earlier and Blatz President Frank Verbest informed the five other breweries that if they did not accept the same settlement, Blatz would “go it alone.” https://content.mpl.org/digital/collection/RememberWhe/id/231",,
